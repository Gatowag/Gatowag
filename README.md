### My name is Brandt Hughes.

I helped establish popular youtube series [Modern Rogue](https://youtube.com/modernrogue) with a small team a number of years ago, and I continue to operate cameras and edit videos for the channel. I have since started up my own youtube series [Emergent Beacon](https://youtube.com/emergentbeacon), all about exploring curiosity and leveraging critical thinking through research projects to learn really cool sciency and design things.

I've only stumbled into programming through various spaces â€” first through After Effects scripting, then StreamDeck macros, modifying the firmware on my mechanical keyboard, and building spreadsheet scripts through Apps Script. I don't have formal programming education, I just teach myself what I need to know to build projects that I find useful.
