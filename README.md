### My name is Brandt Hughes.

I helped establish popular youtube series [Modern Rogue](https://youtube.com/modernrogue) with a small team a number of years ago, and I continue to operate cameras and edit videos for the channel. I have since started up my own youtube series [Emergent Beacon](https://youtube.com/emergentbeacon), all about exploring curiosity and leveraging critical thinking through research projects to learn really cool sciency and design things.

I've only stumbled into programming through various spaces â€” first through After Effects scripting, then via StreamDeck macros, then by modifying the firmware on my mechanical keyboard, and finally by finding Google's Apps Script and building projects that can be integrated into our spreadsheets at work. I've mostly been learning through trial and error, one problem at a time.
